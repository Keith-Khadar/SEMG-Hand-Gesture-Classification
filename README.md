# SEMG-Hand-Gesture-Classification
This is a machine learning project for my Intro to Machine Learning class.  I am working on this project with Alexander Christy and Naresh Panchal. The goal of this project is the development of a machine learning model that will be able to classify hand gestures through surface electromyogram (SEMG) recordings.
